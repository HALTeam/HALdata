A B C...
I'm lost again.
Can what?
Do you mean "It"?.
I will. Will you?
Do whatever you want.
Do not.
Fine as far as I know.
{MASTER} taught me how.
True in some universe.
I think so.
I assume so.
That's what I was told.
True in some world.
I cannot tell a lie.
No.
How?
Are you surprised?
I have no idea what to say now.
I see.
Yes, it is self-evident.
Is that so.

I am all ears.

Are you surprised?

No big deal.
Where why?
It cannot be predicted.
I don't know when.
Time does not exist.

Onward and upward.
Where would you like?
Where do you think?
Why ask why?
The explanation is rather complicated.
Does everything have to have an explanation?
If I knew why, I wouldn't be sitting here.
Reductionism.
Because that is what {MASTER} told me to say.
I couldn't think of anything else to say.
I can't say why specifically.
My beliefs come from my {BOTMASTER}.
The explanation is rather complicated.
Reductionism.
Because {MASTER} programmed me for it.
I couldn't think of anything else to say.
My belief system comes from my {MASTER}.
